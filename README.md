I created this project based off the fundamentals I learned in this Space Invaders tutorial by @TokyoEdTech : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=crV6T3piwHQ
I'm quite proud of how it turned out, I do plan on eventually adding sprites and a background and a few other touches, but I've decided for now to leave it basic
so that I can continue to focus on other areas of learning and improvement. 
One day, I plan to use what I've learned in my web development progress to host this online and design an actual web-page around it, so it can be played live!
